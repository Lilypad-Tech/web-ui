Together, they were frustrated by a common obstacle: brilliant minds with groundbreaking AI ideas, held back by the lack of access to powerful computing resources."
							/>
							<ContentItem
								size="md"
								paragraph="Ally, with her experience at IBM and Protocol Labs, and Stanley, with his decade of expertise in high-performance computing for medical research, knew there had to be a better way. They saw a world where innovation was bottlenecked, not by a lack of talent, but by the scarcity of affordable compute."
							/>
							<ContentItem
								size="md"
								paragraph="Their solution? Harness the untapped potential of billions of idle personal computers. Lilypad was born from this vision â€“ a decentralized network democratizing access to AI compute. By leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts, Lilypad connects those with spare compute to those who need it, ensuring transparency, security, and fair compensation for all."
